After years of preserving the objects entrusted to their care, there was a realization that no attempt was being made to preserve the history of our
museums. As one of the oldest American museums, the Corcoran Gallery of Art joined in the early stages of this movement by creating a repository for the records which document the Gallery's history. The organization of these historic documents has benefited both staff members and scholars who are interested in the Gallery's past activities.

In 2008, due to space reduction, most of the archives' holdings had to be reboxed and were shipped to offsite storage. However, transfer of materials from the Corcoran's various departments to the archives continued until 2014.",prefercite

In 1888, Edward Baltzley purchased 516 acres in Montgomery County, Maryland. In 1889, he and his brother Edwin founded the E &amp; E Baltzley Realty Company and began selling the property as residential lots. In 1891, they established the National Chautauqua of Glen Echo. Glen Echo was also home to Clara Barton and the headquarters of the American Red Cross in this period. In 1903, the Baltzleys lost their holdings in a foreclosure and the property was purchased by Washington Railway and Electric Company. In 1911, Washington Railway and Electric (under the name Glen Echo Park Company) decided to run their own amusement park on the site as a way to both boost weekend railway ticket sales and use surplus electricity. The park closed in 1968, and was obtained by the National Park Service in 1971.
