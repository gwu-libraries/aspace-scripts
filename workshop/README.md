# Agenda

1. JSON data. Getting familliar with JSON.
2. Aspace API GET, edit, POST workflow. An overview of the basic workflow for updating records using the Aspace API.
3. Loops. How can we do stuff more than once?
4. Filter results in Python. In this example we'll look at selecting top level containers that have no location assigned.
5. Search with Solr. Fetch results from the API based on a search instead of a known ID.
6. Edit in OpenRefine. In this section we'll look at loading records into openrefine to edit, and exporting them back out into JSON.
