    "\n",
    "API stands for application programming interface. It's basically set of (hopefully) convenient methods for interacting with and controlling a program. HTTP APIs make these methods availble via the HTTP protocol. This is the same protocol most of us use daily to browse the web. To use HTTP we send requests to a resource and expect to get a response. For example, when you type https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive into your web browser, you're sending an HTTP GET request to Wikipedia, and you expect to get the article on Archives back.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do other types of HTTP requests through our web browsers too, for example, when you fill in a login form with your username and password and hit the login button, you're sending a POST request.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's make some HTTP requests in python\n",

    "You can make HTTP requests from python just like you can from your web browser. To do that, we'll use a set of tools called the requests library. To get the request library, we have to import it like so:"
