# ArchivesSpace (ASpace) Scripts
Scripts using ArchivesSpace's API for querying, adding to, and updating ArchivesSpace data.

To prepare scripts for use:
- Move scripts (/scripts) and configuration files (/configs) into the same folder.
- Open the /configs/secrets.py file and enter all variables.
- Open the /configs/configs.py file and enter all necessary variables. Different variables are required for different scripts, so you may not need to fill in all variables.

Tested with:
- ArchivesSpace 1.4.2 
- Python 3.5.1
